# Burn Coins Contract

## Overview

The Burn Coins Contract is a smart contract designed for the CosmWasm framework. Its primary function is to burn the coins sent to the contract by users.

## Purpose

The purpose of this contract is straightforward: to permanently remove the coins that users send to it. This can be useful in scenarios where token burning is required, such as reducing the supply of a token to increase its scarcity and value, or as part of a token redistribution mechanism.

## Features

- **Coin Burning**: Users can send coins to the contract, and the contract will permanently remove these coins from circulation.

## Usage

1. **Instantiate the Contract**: The contract needs to be instantiated before it can be used. During instantiation, the contract version is set in storage, and the `AMOUNT_BURNT` storage item is initialized with an empty vector.

2. **Execute Coin Burning**: Users can execute the coin burning functionality by sending coins to the contract using the `Burn` execute message. Upon receiving coins, the contract will burn them, i.e., permanently remove them from circulation.

3. **Query Total Burnt Amount**: Users can query the total amount of coins burnt using the `TotalBurntQuery` query message. This allows users to retrieve information about the total amount of coins burnt since the contract was instantiated.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the Burn Coins Contract, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment**: Make sure you have the necessary tools and environment set up for CosmWasm contract development. Refer to the CosmWasm documentation for instructions on setting up your development environment.

2. **Compile Contract**: Compile the Burn Coins Contract using the CosmWasm compiler.

3. **Instantiate Contract**: Instantiate the contract on the desired blockchain network. During instantiation, provide any required initialization parameters.

4. **Interact with the Contract**: Users can interact with the contract by executing the coin burning functionality and querying the total burnt amount as needed.

## Example

Here's an example of how to interact with the Burn Coins Contract:

1. **Instantiate the Contract**:
    ```
    quasard tx wasm instantiate <vault code ID> "" --from <account-name> --keyring-backend <name-of-keyring> --label "burn coins contract" --gas auto --fees <amount-denom> -b block -y --admin <admin-address>
    ```

2. **Execute Coin Burning**:
    ```
    quasard tx wasm execute <contract-address> '{"burn":{}}' -y --from <account-name> --keyring-backend <name-of-keyring> --gas auto --fees <amount-denom> --chain-id <chain-id> --amount <denom-amount,denom-amount>
    ```

3. **Query Total Burnt Amount**:
    ```
    # quasard query wasm contract-state smart <contract-address> '{"total_burnt_query":{}}' --output json
    ```

## Considerations

- **Irreversible**: Coin burning is irreversible. Once coins are burnt, they cannot be recovered.
- **Auditability**: Users should carefully review the contract code and ensure its correctness before interacting with it.

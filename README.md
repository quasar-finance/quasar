Quasar is highly focused in utlising the latest ibc features of cosmos. 
IBC features that we are developing on -

Quasar is implemeting strategies to aggregate users deposited fund to optimally Lping on osmosis dex. 

# Notes - 
1. Quasar is under rapid development phase, and current code base have a lot of testing, experimental redundant code, and info level logs; Which will be removed from the code base in near future based on our testing, and experiments. 
2. Current state of the repo ca not be used directly for a live production as there are many parallel moving developments in different branches.
3. Task management is happening via clickup project mangement internally. So we will not create any github task, till it is in good situation. 

To know more about the project, active branches, current developments please connect with quasar development team.

# Quasar

This is the official Quasar Labs repository. Quasar is building decentralized vaults for creating custom and sovereign investment vehicles in the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond.

Quasar is focused in utilizing the latest and contributing to building IBC features including:
IBC features that we are developing on:
1. Interchain Accounts (ICA).
2. Multihop ibc token transfer (packet forwarder).
3. Interchain Queries (ICQ).

Quasar is working hard to simplfy and add ease to collaborative investment with digital assets. We are creating a decentralized platform for creating custom, soverign vaults that can be molded into any imaginable investment financial instrument from ETFs, mutual fund, SPAC, or whatever. The galaxy is the limit (or maybe the gas fee is ðŸ˜…)  Our flagship product is a vault that implements optimal LPing into pools on Osmosis DEX.

## DISCLAIMER

The current codebase is experimental and undergoing testing and auditing - no code is guaranteed to be ready for production environments at this time.

## Quasar Node

**quasarnode** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite](https://ignite.com) (formerly startport).

### Run Quasar

```bash
make run
```

This will use `ignite` to generate any code from protos, compile the quasar sources and an run the chain locally.

To install the latest version of `ignite`, execute the following command on your machine, or consult the [official documentation](https://github.com/ignite-hq/installer):

```bash
curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | bash
```

#### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`.
To learn more, see the [Ignite docs](https://docs.ignite.com/).

#### Important node commands

```bash
quasarnoded keys list --home ~/.quasarnode/

quasarnoded q qbank user-denom-deposit cosmos146c4e9w55su0czahwxrz8v660p0c2s93cmam6w uqsar

quasarnoded tx qbank request-deposit SENIOR VAULT-01 30000uqsar Days_7 --from alice

quasarnoded q qbank user-denom-deposit cosmos146c4e9w55su0czahwxrz8v660p0c2s93cmam6w uqsar

quasarnoded tx qbank request-withdraw "SENIOR" "VAULT-01" 30000 "uqsar" --from alice

quasarnoded q qbank user-denom-deposit cosmos146c4e9w55su0czahwxrz8v660p0c2s93cmam6w uqsar
```

### Release

To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

## Documentation

All the gRPC endpoints documentation can be generated as a swagger file and served with `swagger-ui`.

First generate the swagger file:

```bash
make docs-gen
```

Then serve it locally using docker:

```bash
make docs-serve
```

## Quasar Local Testnet (localnet)

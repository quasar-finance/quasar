# Quasar

This is the official Quasar Labs repository. Quasar is building decentralized vaults for creating custom and sovereign investment vehicles in the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond.

Quasar is focused in utilizing the latest and contributing to building IBC features including:
IBC features that we are developing on:
1. Interchain Accounts (ICA).
2. Async Interchain Queries (Async - ICQ).
3. IBC hook middleware for token transfer. 

Quasar is working hard to simplfy and add ease to collaborative investment with digital assets. We are creating a decentralized platform for creating custom, soverign vaults that can be molded into any imaginable investment financial instrument from ETFs, mutual fund, SPAC, or whatever. 
The galaxy is the limit. 

Our flagship product starts with vault that implements optimal LPing into pools on Osmosis DEX.

## DISCLAIMER
The current codebase is experimental and undergoing continuous testing and auditing.

# Quasar

This repository is for building yield aggregator and capital management cosmos chain project.

Quasar is highly focused in utlising the latest ibc features of cosmos.
IBC features that we are developing on:
1. Intechain accounts.
2. Multihop ibc token transfer
3. IBC cross chain Lping via ICA.

Quasar initial MVP includes Lping on osmosis dex via IBC messages/ICA. Quasar will provide the one stop for end users to come with their IBC enabled tokens for investment in to the cosmos ecosystem. And that too via just one place.
Quasar is implemeting strategies to aggregate users deposited fund to optimally Lping on osmosis dex.

## Notes

1. Quasar is under rapid development phase, and current code base have a lot of testing, experimental redundant code, and info level logs; Which will be removed from the code base in near future based on our testing, and experiments.
2. Current state of the repo ca not be used directly for a live production as there are many parallel moving developments in different branches.
3. Task management is happening via clickup project mangement internally. So we will not create any github task, till it is in good situation.

## Current active branches

1. quasarnode_integrated_ak
2. quasarnode_orion_reward_ak
3. add_gauge_apy_type_and_msg

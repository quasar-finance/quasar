# Wasm <> Intergamm
In this demo, we setup 3 chains, quasar, cosmos-hub and osmosis and we demonstrate that all messages from intergamm can be succesfully sent from a smart contract on quasar to osmosis and that the smart contract is able to receive and respond to acknowledgments from intergamm

## Prerequisites
- The compiled intergamm-bindings-test contract
- quasarnoded compiled
- Local  Gaia repo
- Local Osmosis repo

## Setting up
### Running the chains

### Setting up the IBC channels
### Storing and Instantiating the test contract
## Doing the test
### Calling the smart contract
### Checking the results
#### Checking the results on chain
#### Checking the state of the smart contract

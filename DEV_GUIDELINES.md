# Development Guidelines

## Pull requests
In order to allow fast and efficient reviews, please create small PRs per independent change instead of big ones for a full feature. 

**Rule of thumb**: It should be easy to formulate the commit message as a one-liner. If that is not the case, then the PR is probably to big.
